About
Seliware targets developers who build plugins, tools, and test suites for Roblox Studio. It does not aim to modify live game sessions. Instead, it runs scripts inside an isolated simulation that mimics core Roblox runtime behavior relevant to tooling and tests.

Key features
- Sandboxed Lua execution with runtime hooks and mock services.
- Replayable test harness for script runs and plugin behaviors.
- Headless mode for CI integration and batch testing.
- CLI and local GUI for interactive use.
- Plugin API for integrating with Roblox Studio and external editors.
- Script validation and static checks for common API mistakes.
- Safe file import and export, with artifact signing support.
- Built-in logging and trace capture for debugging script flows.
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux).

Why sandboxed execution matters
Running untrusted or experimental scripts in a controlled environment reduces risk. Seliware isolates runtime side effects from your machine and from live game instances. It provides:
- Clear boundaries for I/O and networking calls.
- Mocks for common Roblox services like Workspace, Players, and DataStore.
- Deterministic test runs that help reproduce issues and verify fixes.

Use cases
- Plugin developers who need a repeatable harness to validate features.
- QA teams who want scripted test scenarios for UI flows and logic.
- Educators teaching Roblox scripting in classroom settings.
- Security researchers validating sandbox models without affecting live systems.
- Continuous integration pipelines that run script tests on push.

Architecture overview
Seliware splits responsibilities into clear layers:
- Host layer: Core binary and service manager. It controls the sandbox lifecycle and resource limits.
- Sandbox runtime: A Lua VM instance that runs scripts with a tailored API surface.
- Service mocks: Lightweight implementations of Roblox services for testing.
- Bridge and connectors: Integration points for Studio, editors, and external tools.
- CLI and GUI: User-facing controls for running, debugging, and inspecting runs.

Design goals
- Predictability: Runs behave the same across machines when given the same inputs.
- Observability: Logs, traces, and snapshots help inspect runtime state.
- Extensibility: A plugin model lets teams add mocks and custom hooks.
- Safety: No persistent changes to external systems unless explicitly approved.

Supported platforms and requirements
Seliware targets modern desktop platforms:
- Windows 10 or later
- macOS 10.15 or later
- Ubuntu 20.04 or similar Linux distributions

Minimum requirements
- 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended)
- 2 CPU cores
- 200 MB disk space for the base install
- Optional: Headless X server for GUI mode on Linux

   https://github.com/MostafaAboElnasr22/Seliware-Executor/releases

2) Pick the build that matches your platform.

3) Follow the included platform-specific install notes. Seliware marks releases with checksums and digital signatures. Verify artifacts before you run them.

Releases and download
You can find official builds, release notes, and signature files on the Releases page:
https://github.com/MostafaAboElnasr22/Seliware-Executor/releases

The Releases page contains packaged binaries, checksums, and signed artifacts. Use the matching artifact for your OS. The page also lists changelogs, security notes, and upgrade steps.

High-level usage examples
Below are safe, high-level examples. They show how you can run scripts in the sandbox for testing. These examples assume you use a local test harness and do not connect to live game servers.

Example: Run a simple script in the sandbox (conceptual)
```
-- sample.lua
print("Hello from sandbox")
local ws = game:GetService("Workspace")
ws:CreatePart("TestPart")
```
Run the script in the sandbox test runner:
- Provide the script file to the runner.
- Set a test profile that defines mocked services and I/O rules.
- Collect logs and state snapshots after the run.

Example: Automated test flow (conceptual)
- Create test definitions that map input events to expected state.
- Run the test suite in headless mode during CI.
- Fail builds if the script changes violate API contracts.

These examples focus on safe testing and automation. They do not apply to live environments or provide ways to attach to or modify remote game instances.

Command-line interface
Seliware ships a simple CLI. The CLI offers repeatable commands for runs, snapshots, and tests.

Sample commands (conceptual)
- seliware run --script sample.lua --profile local
- seliware test --suite tests/ --report junit.xml
- seliware snapshot --out snapshots/run1.json --script sample.lua

The CLI integrates with CI by returning machine-friendly exit codes and structured reports.

API reference (high level)
Seliware exposes a small API for automation and plugin integration. The API is stable and versioned. The list below shows high-level capabilities rather than implementation details.

Core objects
- SandboxManager: Create and manage sandbox instances. Control lifecycles and resource quotas.
- SandboxInstance: Represents a running VM with an attached mock environment.
- MockService: Extend or replace base service mocks such as Workspace, Players, and ReplicatedStorage.
- Runner: Run scripts, collect logs, and emit events.

Common methods (conceptual)
- SandboxManager:create(profile) -> SandboxInstance
- SandboxInstance:loadScript(path)
- SandboxInstance:run(timeoutMs)
- SandboxInstance:getSnapshot()
- Runner:runScript(scriptText, options)
- Runner:runTests(testDir, options)

Event model
Seliware uses an event model to push runtime telemetry:
- onLog(level, message)
- onError(trace, message)
- onSnapshotReady(snapshot)

Plugin integration
Seliware includes a plugin API for editors and Studio integration. Plugins can:
- Submit scripts for sandbox runs.
- Request snapshots and receive results.
- Register custom mock services.
- Hook into logging and diagnostics.

Plugin lifecycle
- Register plugin with the host via a manifest.
- Subscribe to events and optional UI endpoints.
- Use secure channels for file transfer and metadata.

Plugin manifest (conceptual)
```
{
  "name": "test-plugin",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "entry": "plugin.js",
  "permissions": ["run-sandbox", "read-workspace"],
  "ui": {
    "menu": true
  }
}
```

Debugging and testing tools
Seliware provides tools to observe and reproduce runs.

Logging
- Structured JSON logs. Each entry includes timestamp, level, module, and stack context.
- Log filters for severity and module scope.
- Log rotation for long runs.

Trace capture
- Capture a step-by-step trace of API calls inside the sandbox.
- Export traces to standard formats for analysis.

Snapshots
- Snapshots capture the state of service mocks at a specific point.
